# ASSIGNMENT 5:  Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python
 


This repository contains solutions for **Assignment 3** of **Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python**. It includes two Python scripts that demonstrate fundamental Python concepts such as dictionaries, list slicing, and basic data manipulation.

## Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

### Description
This script demonstrates how to use a Python dictionary to store and retrieve student data. It initializes a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values. The program then prompts the user to enter a student's name, retrieves and displays the corresponding marks, and provides an appropriate message if the student's name is not found.

## Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

### Description
This script showcases the powerful list slicing feature in Python. It creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10, then uses list slicing to extract the first five elements. Furthermore, it demonstrates how to reverse these extracted elements using another slicing technique. Both the extracted and reversed lists are printed to illustrate the results.
